::: {.callout-note}
-  A co-requisite for Statistics-2 is Maths-2. So either Maths-2 has to be done before Statistics-2 or both can be taken together. Statistics-2 cannot be done without having done Maths-2.  
-  All the 8 Foundation courses should be completed before the candidate can register to any Year 2 Diploma level course.
