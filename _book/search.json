    "text": "IIT Madras has launched the BS in Data Science and Applications. In this program, the course contents are delivered online and can be studied by anyone from anywhere, while the monthly quizzes and final semester exams will have to be attended in-person at designated centres.\nDepending on the number of courses completed, learners can earn:\n\na Foundation level certificate\n\nDiploma in Programming / Diploma in Data Science / both\n\nBSc degree in Programming and Data Science\n\nBS degree in Data Science and Applications\n\n\n1. Highlights of the Programme\nCourses are taught by faculty of IIT Madras, other reputed institutes, and experts from the industry.\nUnlike many competitive admission exams which work on the philosophy of elimination and selection — admitting a very limited number of learners based on relative performance — this programme follows qualifying criteria, allowing a significantly large number of learners to enroll.\nLearners from any background — engineering, sciences, humanities, arts, medicine, law, etc. — can attempt and join this programme.\nThere are no restrictions on age or geographical location.",

    "text": "Flexibility\nThere are two entry and four exit points, with learners being able to exit with either course certificates, or diploma or the degree. Learners can choose their pace of study every term. Being an online programme, there is no geographical barrier to learning from this programme — learners only need to travel to exam centres for exams each term.\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: This programme is NOT BASED on an admission process. Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.\nFor example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree programme after the Qualifier. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on successful completion makes them eligible to enter the Diploma level.\nThe diplomas or degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.\nAdmission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with the Diploma or the degree.",
