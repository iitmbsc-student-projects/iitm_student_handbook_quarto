Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.\nFor example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree programme after the Qualifier. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on successful completion makes them eligible to enter the Diploma level.\nThe diplomas or degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.\nAdmission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with the Diploma or the degree.",
